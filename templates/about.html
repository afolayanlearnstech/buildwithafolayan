        <h2>AFOLAYAN FAVOUR AYO-OLUWA</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am a specialist developer and digital strategist focused on building custom web applications that solve real-world business challenges and drive efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>The Python Advantage</h3>
        <p>
            While many websites are built on generic templates, I build custom web applications using Python. This is a significant advantage for your business. A robust Python backend is perfect for securely handling sensitive user data and gives us the power to create true custom integrations with your existing softwareâ€”automating your workflows in ways template-based sites simply cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is not just to build you a website, but to build you a custom-fit, secure, and automated business solution that reduces your administrative workload and helps you serve your customers more effectively.
        </p>
