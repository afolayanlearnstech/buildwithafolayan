      THIS IS THE FIX:
      1. We use the original <img> tag with the class "profile-pic".
      2. We replace its 'src' with the correct path to your image.
      3. We remove the extra "about-image" div.

        <h2>AFOLAYAN FAVOUR AYO-OLUWA</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am a specialist developer and digital strategist with a dedicated focus on the high-end dental industry. My passion is building custom, secure, and efficient web applications that solve the unique challenges of modern dental practices.
        </p>

        <h3>The Python Advantage</h3>
        <p>
            While many dental sites are built on generic templates, I build custom web applications using Python. This is a significant advantage for your practice. A robust Python backend is perfect for securely handling sensitive Patient Health Information (PHI) and gives us the power to create true custom integrations with your Practice Management Software (PMS)â€”automating your workflows in ways template-based sites simply cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is not just to build you a website, but to build you a custom-fit, secure, and automated business solution that reduces administrative workload and helps you attract and retain high-value patients.
        </p>
